# Playtation 2 Clock

A Love2D project

The purpose is to bring the Playstation 2 clock to your screen in either the screensaver or wallpaper of your computer. By providing the executable, you can use your favorite methods of applying it to your screensaver or wallpaper.

## Todo

* Add glowing orbs that spin around in the center of the clock that represent seconds
* Add a tunnel like background to replace the dark solid color
* Possibly improve the visuals to help mimic more of the  Playstation 2 clock
* Optimise as much as possible and reduce the processing power required to run the program as it isn't meant to be ran like a typical application, or in this case, a game
