# Playtation 2 Clock

A Love2D project

The purpose is to bring the Playstation 2 clock to your screen in either the screensaver or wallpaper of your computer. By providing ***only the executable and its required libraries***, you can use your favorite methods of applying it to your screensaver or wallpaper. This does **not** provide those applications that assists in those methods.

The behavior of the display is being made in reference to the documentation of the clock in [this wiki](https://gamicus.gamepedia.com/PlayStation_2_internal_display_clock).

## Creating the Executable

If you want to make adjustments or improvements and test it out on your own computer, there is already some nice and simple tutorials in Love2D's wiki for [Windows](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution#Creating_a_Windows_Executable), [Mac](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution#Creating_a_macOS_Application), and [Linux](https://love2d.org/wiki/Game_Distribution#Distribution_for_Linux).

## Todo

* Make glowing orbs represent seconds with its special patterns
* Add a tunnel like background to replace the dark solid color
* Possibly improve the visuals to help mimic more of the  Playstation 2 clock
* Optimize as much as possible and reduce the processing power required to run the program as it isn't meant to be ran like a typical application, or in this case, a game
